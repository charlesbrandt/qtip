    <p>Q-TIP is a free online tool for quantitatively investigating people’s qualitative understanding of complex topics. It is based on Q-method, a social science research technique in which participants sort different statements about a topic by how much they agree with the statement. Q-TIP enables researchers to define shared viewpoints based on subjects’ responses to many questions about a single topic. A collection of useful resources on Q-method exists <a href="http://qmethod.org/howto">here</a>. </p>
